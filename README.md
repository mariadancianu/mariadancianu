### :woman_technologist: About me 

I’m Maria, a **Data Scientist** based near Milan 🇮🇹, with experience building customer-facing LLM systems in production.

From 2019 to 2024, I worked at [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), a London-based energy monitoring startup, focusing on ML-driven energy disaggregation on high-frequency time-series energy data.

Since early 2025 I have been working at [Ingo](https://ingo.it/), an AI‑based CX and omnichannel solutions company, developing production LLM assistants for voice, email, and chat, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like agentic AI workflows, with API integrations, CRM integrations (e.g. Zendesk), RAG, and more.

Always curious and eager to experiment, I’m currently deepening my LLM post-training skills outside of work, focusing on fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via hands-on projects and courses.

I’m especially excited by cutting-edge technologies and their potential to drive meaningful change. I’m drawn to fields where data is used as a force for good, leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and create a positive impact!

When I’m not working, I spend time hiking, learning to swim, and taking Spanish lessons — activities that keep me inspired and balanced.
