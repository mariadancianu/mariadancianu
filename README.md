### :woman_technologist: About me 
I'm a **Data Scientist** based in Italy, somewhere between the city of Milan and the beautiful italian Alps. 

I have more than **5 years of Python development working experience** in the Energy & Utilities Data Analytics field.   
I have experience with **sensor-based high frequency time-series data** and **Real Time Analytics**. 

In the past 5 years I cooperated with a team of brilliant Data Engineers and Data Scientists to design and deliver reliable, high-quality and cost-effective software solutions for complex business requirements, including **Live Analytics Applications**.

I'm currently learning and experimenting with some cool stuff (keep reading for more details). <br />
Also checkout my learning journey and published code solutions on [exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/mary94). 

On a personal note, I spend a lot of my free time hiking, hitting the gym, going to photography exhibitions and watching tennis tournaments. 


I am **actively searching for a new position.**
