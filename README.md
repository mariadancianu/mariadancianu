### :woman_technologist: About me 

Iâ€™m Maria, a **Data Scientist** living just outside Milan, Italy. For the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve been working at [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), an innovative energy monitoring startup based in London. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of collaborating with an incredible team and tackling some really interesting and complex Data Analytics challenges.

Curiosity drives me, and Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new things to learn and experiment with. Lately, Iâ€™ve been deepening my skills through online courses, with a strong focus on **AWS** and **Generative AI**.

In particular, Iâ€™m diving into **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, working on building and evaluating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangChain**, **Hugging Face**, and **Ragas**. This hands-on experience is helping me refine my understanding of LLM pipelines, retrieval mechanisms, and evaluation frameworks.

At the same time, Iâ€™m exploring tools that enhance my productivityâ€”right now, Vim and Bash are essential in my workflow, allowing me to work more efficiently and streamline my development process.

Iâ€™m especially excited by cutting-edge technologies and their potential to drive meaningful change. Iâ€™m drawn to fields where data is used as a force for good, leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and create a positive impact!

When Iâ€™m not immersed in data, I enjoy photography, hiking, and playing tennisâ€”passions that keep me balanced and inspired.
